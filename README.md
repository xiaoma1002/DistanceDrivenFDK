# DistanceDrivenFDK

This repo is used as a record of a research on 3d reconstruction algorithm (Distance-Driven Back Projection of FDK Algorithm) in 2018

In the field of cone-beam CT reconstruction, FDK type reconstruction algorithm is widely used. 
For this kind of algorithm, the image back-projection step is the most time-consuming one. 
In this research, a variety of back-projection methods are compared, and a version that uses spatial geometry properties, 
engineering skills, and derived algorithms is introduced for the Distance Driven back-projection algorithm. 
Both the algorithm and the optimized version are implemented using the CPU and the CUDA parallel computing platform.

Techniques:
   - Algorithms/Models: Three-dimensional reconstruction, back-projection reconstruction, FDK, Distance-driven
   - Frameworks/Libraries: RTK, ITK
   - Languages: C++, CUDA C

Part of the codes are shown public in this repo. You are welcome to contact me and ask any questions about this project.
